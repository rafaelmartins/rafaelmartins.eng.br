TITLE: Projects
---------------
I'm always working on open-source projects, mostly just for fun. The bigger
projects are hosted on their own GitHub organizations:

- [balde](https://github.com/balde)
- [blogc](https://github.com/blogc)

All the other projects, proofs of concepts and code snippets are hosted on my
GitHub account:

- [rafaelmartins](https://github.com/rafaelmartins)
