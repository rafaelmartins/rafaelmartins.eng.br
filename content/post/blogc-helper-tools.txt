--------------------------
While users may be able to use `blogc` as is with the help of generic tools,
some of these tools are really boring to setup.

With that in mind, I'm trying to develop some simple tools to help the users
getting their blogs online. At this point I have two tools ready for usage:

* [blogc-git-receiver](https://github.com/blogc/blogc-git-receiver)
* [blogc-runserver](https://github.com/blogc/blogc-runserver)

Packages are available for Gentoo, and in my [Copr
repository](https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/rafaelmartins/blogc) for
RHEL/CentOS/Fedora.


#### blogc-git-receiver

```blogc-git-receiver``` is a login shell and a git pre-receive hook, that
can create git repositories and build/deploy your websites automatically.
Users just need to create an user, configure it to use
```blogc-git-receiver``` as its login shell, then every time that some
authorized user pushes to a repository it will create a local bare
repository in the server, if needed, and if the push includes some change to
the master branch, it will rebuild your website for you.

```blogc-git-receiver``` tries to be as atomic as possible, building the new
version of the website in a separate directory, and using a symlink to point
to the most recent version of the website, removing the old version only
after a successful new build.

```blogc-git-receiver``` creates a symlink inside the bare git repository,
called ```htdocs```, that points to the last successful build. Users just need
to make their webservers use this symlink as document root for their virtual
host, and make sure that the webserver can follow symlinks.

With this tool, users can create their own PaaS-like environment, using a
[cheap VPS](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=80aa4a1d3a77) to host lots
of blogs. ;-)

This tool is one of the reasons why I wanted to make ```blogc``` as fast as
possible, because it will rebuild all the website every time, not just the
changes, for the sake of consistency.

This tool is also a good sample code for people interested in understand how
a login shell and a git hook works.

Gentoo package is ```dev-vcs/blogc-git-receiver``` and RHEL/CentOS/Fedora
package is ```blogc-git-receiver```.

Some simple documentation is available at:
[[https://github.com/blogc/blogc-git-receiver]]


#### blogc-runserver

```blogc-runserver``` is a simple HTTP server, that comes with several rules
pre-defined, that tries to mimic the way most production servers work when
serving static websites. Users just need to point ```blogc-runserver``` to the
output directory where ```blogc``` created its result files.

A simple ```Makefile``` rule is able to run your website for testing:

    serve: all
    	blogc-runserver $(OUTPUT_DIR)

Yeah, it is really that simple! :)

Please keep in mind that this server should not be used in production. It is
really simple, and developed for testing purposes.

Gentoo package is ```www-servers/blogc-runserver``` and RHEL/CentOS/Fedora
package is ```blogc-runserver```.

Some simple documentation is available at:
[[https://github.com/blogc/blogc-runserver]]


#### Other tools

I have more ideas of new tools, that I will probably explain in future posts,
but if you have ideas of useful tools, please [let me know](/about/).

Thanks.
