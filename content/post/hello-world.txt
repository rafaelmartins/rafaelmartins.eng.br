Hi all,

I'm starting a new blog!

Actually, it is almost the same blog, but powered by a new "blogging engine",
and I don't want to spend time migrating the old posts, that are mostly
outdated right now.

The old content is archived here, if you need it due to some crazy reason:
[[http://old.rafaelmartins.eng.br/]].

For Gentoo planet readers, everything should be working just fine. I created
rewrite rules to keep the old atom feeds working.

I'll publish another blog post soon, talking about the "blogging engine" and
my next plans.

Thanks.
