![Rafael Martins](/assets/img/rafael.jpg)

My name is Rafael Goncalves Martins. I'm a Control and Automation engineer,
programmer and open-source developer.

I'm currently working for [Titans Group](http://titansgroup.com.br/), as
Software Architect.

I spend almost all my free time playing with open-source stuff. The main
projects I'm working on are [Gentoo Linux](http://www.gentoo.org/),
[balde](http://balde.io/) and [blogc](http://blogc.org/).

On the personal-side, I'm a 27 years old guy, single, living at SÃ£o Paulo/SP,
Brazil.
